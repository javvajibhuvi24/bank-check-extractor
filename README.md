## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project relies on Tesseract OCR. Please ensure you have Tesseract OCR installed on your system and its executable is in your system's PATH. You can find installation instructions for various operating systems on the [Tesseract GitHub page](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html).

### Installation

Build `bank-check-extractor` from the source and install dependencies:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/javvajibhuvi24/bank-check-extractor.git](https://github.com/javvajibhuvi24/bank-check-extractor.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd bank-check-extractor
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
